# Continental AG Internship June-December, 2023
`June 29, 2023` - I have deferred the start of my EECS Masters commencement until January 2024. This is in order to accomodate my software engineering internship with Continental AG.


## About Continental
Continental supplies everything from tires, to high-tech sensors that enable vehicle smart features. Their products are incorporated by a handful of car manufacturers, but the brand is most recognized as a car tire manufacturer.

Automotive-grade components must meet especially high standards, especially when needing to win bids from car manufacturers. As automakers increasingly adopt advanced driver-assist systems, there's a growing demand for a blend of radar, LiDAR, and traditional camera technologies. Continental is positioning to be a competitor in this market by developing an automotive-specific solution of LiDAR to add to their suite of smart automotive sensors.

Continentals Carpinteria office is dedicated to the research and development of these LiDAR systems, working there gave me hands on experience within a state-of-the-art software and hardware development environment. 


## Roles, Responsibilities, & Projects

- **Device Bootloader:** Worked closely with this component to develop unit tests for low-level functions.
- **Lab Device Control:** Authored scripts to programmatically control a suite of lab devices.
- **LiDAR Pixel Testing:** Created an automated test sequence to isolate and evaluate individual pixels on the LiDAR Rx photo array.
- **Temperature Analysis:** Conducted performance analyses of individual pixels at varying temperatures within a heat-controlled chamber.
