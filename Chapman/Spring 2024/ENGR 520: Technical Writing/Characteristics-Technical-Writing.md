  - Acquisition vs Acquire
  - Analysis vs Analyze
  - Recommendation vs Recommend

- Make sure words convey the meaning you intend.
- Avoid using figurative language in technical writing.
- Separate facts from opinions by using phrases like "we believe," "we recommend," or "in our opinion"

### Active voice vs Passive
- Want to use as much active voice, more concise
- Active voice emphasizes the person/thing doing the action in a sentence
- Passive voice emphasizes the receiver of the action
