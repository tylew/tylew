# Blog

## Idea

I know many people like to blog. As a creative and curious mind, I would like to start blogging. I think this may be helpful in keeping track of my ideas, projects, and progress in such.

I have long had ideas about creating a master directory of personal written documents. I would prefer to have a personalized website to display my entries, but am more interested in writing than dumping a bunch of time into a custom front-end. Storing these records in a GitHub repository will be most suitable. I can eventually port these md files over to a personalized website.

## About me

I am awaiting to start my Masters in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science degree at Chapman University. I have deferred the start of this program until January 2024 to accomodate an internship with Continental AG as a software engineer.
