# Continental AG Internship June-December, 2023

I have deferred the start of my EECS Masters commencement until January 2024. This is in order to accomodate my software engineering internship with Continental AG.

Continentals Carpinteria office, where I worked, is dedicated to the research and development of automotive-grade LiDAR systems. This opportunity gave me hands on experience with state-of-the-art software and hardware development procedures. Despite being aquired as a software engineering intern, I was able to explore the intersection of both software and hardware, working on projects involving both aspects.

## About Continental
Continental supplies everything from tires and other rubber products, to high-tech sensors that enable vehicle smart features. Their products are incorporated by a handful of car manufacturers, bit their brand is most recognized as a car tire manufacturer.

The concept of LiDAR is nearly a century old, but automotive-grade components must meet especially high standards, especially when needing to win bids from car manufacturers. Every car manufacturer will likely adopt enhanced driver-assist features in some if not all of their vehicles. These features will require some complexion of radar, LiDAR, and traditional cameras. Continental is positioning to be a competitor in this market by developing an automotive-specific solution for LiDAR to add to their suite of smart automotive sensors.


## Projects

- Configuration of sensor testbed 

This project required me to create programatic controls to control all the devices in a lab. I created interfaces to control an oven, laser light attenuator, precision motors, and LiDAR sensor in a testbed environment. This was my first project during my internship and this testbed was further used for the thermal distance-calibration testing project.

  - EVS

  EVS, the in-house software to interface with Continental-flashed LiDAR sensors, is still in the early stanges of development. It tends to be unstable and is difficult to work with. Very frustrating.

- Unit Tests for operating system bootloader 

Working alongside production engineers I created unit-tests for the production boot-loader. Although I was not directly contributing to production code, it was intriguing to be exposed to production code and delve into the largest codebase I had ever seen.
