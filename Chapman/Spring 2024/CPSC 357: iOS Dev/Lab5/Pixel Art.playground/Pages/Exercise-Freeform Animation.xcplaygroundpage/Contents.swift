 ## Exercise: Freeform Animation

 This page is left blank for you to create your own animations. Feel free to explore the possibilities:

 - Set and clear individual pixels in a loop to create simple mini-animations.
 - Use the sprite functions built into this page (the person and smiley components from the previous pages) to animate sprites.
 - Try using `if` statements to draw different things in different loop iterations.
 - Use an array of pixels to draw a shape, your signature, or anything else using one line. Use a loop to draw the line one pixel at a time.

 On this page, you can use the `displaySize` variable to choose between four display resolutions. Its value defaults to .fortyByForty. Be sure to set `displaySize` *first*, before any of your code.
 */
displaySize = .fortyByForty
