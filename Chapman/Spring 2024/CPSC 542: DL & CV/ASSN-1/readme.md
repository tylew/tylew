1. ### Identify a vision dataset to work with for classification tasks:

For assignment completion, I used the **[MNIST dataset (link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset)**. 

The database contains 70,000 BW images of handwritten numeric character depictions:

The only Computer Vision exposure I have had prior to this assignment/class is using Euclidean Distance K-nearest neighbors to predict labels from this specific dataset. 

Achieved ~0.9 accuracy using K-Nearest, but Convolutional Neural Network is vastly advantageous. 

2. ### Prove the classification task requires a deep learning solution:

A deep learning solution such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is suitable for the task of classifying the MNIST dataset.

A CNN, specifically, is able to recognize patterns regardless of their location in the image, crucial to accurately identify patterns exhibited by handwritten characters.

Such classification task may be used to efficiently transcribe scanned documents. This would likely be useful in digitizing historical texts. A Deep Learning solution provides competitive efficiency.
