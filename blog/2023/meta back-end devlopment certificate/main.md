Devices connect through a network

A `network` is made up of at least two devices that connect and communicate via a wired or wireless connection. One network switch can connect to another switch to link two networks.

`Network switch` allows multiple devices to communicate with eachother

`Interconnected network` refers to interconnected switches and forms 'the internet'
