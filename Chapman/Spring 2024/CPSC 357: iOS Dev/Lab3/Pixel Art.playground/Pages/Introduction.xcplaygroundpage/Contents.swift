 ## Pixel Art
 
 Back in the old days of personal computing—when bit-mapped displays were new—pixels were a more precious commodity than they are now. For example, in the 1980s, the Apple II had a 40-by-40 pixel display, which made for very low-resolution graphics. And colors weren't as plentiful either. Many displays at the time had pixels that were either on or off, and the fancy ones offered only a handful of colors. The Apple II gave users a choice of 16 colors in low-res graphics mode.
 
 Programmers back then did lots of their work pixel by pixel, hand-crafting all of the graphics on the screen.
 
 In this playground, you'll create low-resolution graphics one pixel at a time. You're unlikely to do this as an app developer, but it's a fun way to explore some basics of graphics and to put yourself in the shoes of developers who've gone before you.
 
 Next, get started with pixels.
