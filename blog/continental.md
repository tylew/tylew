# Continental AG Internship June-December, 2023

I have deferred the start of my EECS Masters commencement until January 2024. This is in order to accomodate my software engineering internship with Continental Automotive.

This opportunity with Continental gave me hands on experience with state-of-the-art automotive-grade LiDAR modules. As a software engineering intern, I explored the intersection of hardware and software and worked on projects involving both of these aspects.

## About Continental
Continental supplies everything from tires and other rubber products, to high-tech sensors that enable vehicle smart features. Their products can be found in a handful of European car manufacturers and their brand is most recognizes as a car-tire manufacturer.

The concept of LiDAR is nearly a century old, but automotive-grade components must meet especially high standards, especially when needing to win bids from car manufacturers. Every car manufacturer will likely adopt enhanced driver-assist features in some if not all of their vehicles. These features will require some complexion of radar, LiDAR, and traditional cameras. Continental is positioning to be a competitor in this market by developing an automotive-specific solution for LiDAR.


## Projects

- Configuration of sensor testbed 

This project required me to creat programatic controls to control all the devices in a lab. I created software to control the oven, light attenuator, motors, and LiDAR sensor in a testbed environment. This was my first project during my internship and this testbed was further used for the thermal distance-calibration testing project.

- Thermal distance-calibration of LiDAR camera pixel array



- Unit Tests for operating system bootloader 

Working alongside production engineers I created unit-tests for the production boot-loader. Although I was not directly contributing to production code, it was intriguing to delve into a codebase larger than one I have ever seen before.
