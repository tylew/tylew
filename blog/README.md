# Blog

## Idea

Many people like to blog. I am a creative and curious mind and I would like to start blogging. I think this may be helpful in keeping track of my ideas, projects, and progress in such.

I have long had ideas about creating a master directory of personal written documents. I would prefer to have a personalized website to display my entries, but am more interested in producing content than dumping a bunch of time into a custom front-end. Storing these records in a GitHub repository will be most suitable and I can eventually port these .md files over to a personalized website.
