4 weeks into school. This last one flew by like nobodys business.

School is starting to ramp up, now is the time to double down and ensure you are prepared for the end of the semester. Don't want to be re-learning old concepts when the final comes around.

There are a handful of things assigned from each class, lets run through them:

- ENGR 520: Technical writing

- EENG 511: Control Systems

- EENG 389: RF Systems

- CPSC 357: iOS development

- CPSC 542: Deep learning and computer vision

- ENGR 501: Ethics
